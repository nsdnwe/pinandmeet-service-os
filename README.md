PinAndMeet Service
===

This version is for VS2015 but can be opened to newer version.

First. Find in files string: [Input here] and set your tokens and passwords.

Database is not included but one is created automatically when solution is started and some service is called. Just make sure you have correct password in web.config.

Good luck!
